## Firing up a server using Python

If you are a Windows user, install Python and from inside the `app` directory run:

```
$ python -m http.server 8080
```

or on a Mac/*nix machine, run:

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

You can of course also use WAMP or an alternative tool for serving up content.
